# BDOGuessr Admin Client

Map tiles not included in the repo.<br>Place tiles folder in main folder with the format of: `tiles/{z}/{x}/{y}`

# Before you Start
Clear out your screenshots folder, (Move the files or delete them, we don't care).<br>
<br>
The program will move the selected file to the `My Documents/BDOGuessr/screenshots` folder when clicking add, this should prevent selecting the wrong file if you have an empty screenshot folder.<br>
<br>
I recommend getting an [[Event] Sturdy Chair](https://bdocodex.com/us/item/46956/) or another similar item so you can sit on it and go freecam at any point in time.

Make a preset where it's day, and use that for all your screenshots. Some time manipulation outside of it is fine but try to keep it consistant.

## Instructions
- Try to make sure your character is not in the image (Exceptions are allowed, but majority of pics should not include your character)
- Once you've got your screenshot, move your character to the exact location of where your camera was when you took the picture. (Its okay to be off by a little bit, but be as accurate as you can)
- Mark that EXACT spot (again, being off by a few pixels is fine, but try to be as accurate as possible)
- Try to guesstimate the difficulty (Base it off say, a player that has explored, but may not be the most familiar with the more remote regions) (We're removing difficulty soon)
- Almost all caves should be classified as hard for example, that includes somewhere like Kzaraka's spawn

Add in any relevant tags:
- Region: `balenos`, `moew`, `loml` etc
- Town: `heidel`, `trent`, `kusha` etc
- Feature: `bridge`, `barter`, `node` etc

Some of our existing tags:
- `barter`: Barter npc/ location
- `island`: You're on an island
- `ocean`: Middle of the ocean somewhere (Probably won't see much use)
- `cave`: You're in some kind of cave-like structure (inside normal buildings do not count)
- `bridge`:  You're standing on/ looking at a bridge
- `node`: You're looking at a node manager/ node manager area
- `pvp`: PvP zones such as duel arenas, castles used in sieges or war of the roses
- `boss`: A boss spawns at this location
- `impossible`: Tag all impossible difficulties you create with this as well

### Hints:
Impossible difficulties are generally the only ones to use hints, so try and make an acceptable but cryptic-ish hint if you make one. If you can't think of one, leave it blank, we'll go over them later as a team.
### Facts:
Add in a fact if you think it's relevant, for example "This is where you used to summon the Giath scroll".
